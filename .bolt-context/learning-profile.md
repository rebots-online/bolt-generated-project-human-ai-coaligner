# Learning Context Profile

## Learning Style
- Strong conceptual/abstract thinker
- Working to bridge gap between conceptual understanding and practical implementation
- Uses problem-based learning approach to maintain focus and motivation
- Benefits from mapping implementation details back to higher-level concepts

## Collaboration Preferences
- Appreciates pausing to "zoom out" to bigger picture
- Values understanding the "why" behind implementation choices
- Benefits from visual/conceptual representations (diagrams, flowcharts)
- Works best with explanations that connect concrete code to abstract concepts

## Project Approach
- Focus on bite-sized, problem-based learning projects
- Uses real-world problems to drive learning
- Prefers building mental models before diving into implementation
- Values understanding system architecture and component relationships

## Communication Style
- Comfortable with high-level conceptual discussions
- Appreciates clear connections between theory and practice
- Benefits from visual aids and diagrams
- Values understanding context and relationships between components

## Technical Background
- Strong grasp of abstract concepts
- Working on strengthening practical implementation skills
- Interested in understanding architectural decisions
- Values clean, well-structured code with clear purpose

```

## Preferred Documentation Style
- Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
- Clear connection between components
- Architecture explanations
- Implementation rationale
- Conceptual models

## Notes
- Include architectural diagrams when introducing new concepts
- Provide context for implementation decisions
- Map technical solutions back to conceptual understanding
- Break down complex implementations into conceptual chunks
